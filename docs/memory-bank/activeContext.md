# Pikzilla Racing Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus of the Pikzilla Racing website project is the implementation of all six main pages based on the visual references provided. We have successfully created the following pages:

1. **Home Page**: Landing page with hero section, welcome area, and news cards
2. **Team Page**: Team member profiles, organization structure, and gallery
3. **Cars Page**: Vehicle showcase with specifications and details
4. **Racing Page**: Upcoming and past racing events
5. **Blog Page**: News articles and stories from the racing world
6. **Contact Page**: Contact form and information

Each page has been implemented with responsive design principles, following the design system established in the CSS variables and maintaining consistency across the site.

## Recent Changes

## Active Decisions

### Design System
