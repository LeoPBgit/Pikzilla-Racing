# Security and Backup Guide for Pikzilla Racing

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures and backup procedures implemented for the Pikzilla Racing project to ensure data protection, system integrity, and business continuity.

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: Repository Security

**GitHub Repository Protection:**
- Private repository with controlled access
- Branch protection rules on master branch
- Required pull request reviews for changes
- Signed commits enforcement (recommended)
- Dependabot security alerts enabled

**Access Control:**
- Repository access limited to authorized team members
- Two-factor authentication required for all contributors
- Regular access review and permission audits
- SSH keys or personal access tokens for secure authentication

### Layer 2: Code Security

**Secure Development Practices:**
- Input validation on all forms
- XSS prevention through proper output encoding
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Regular security code reviews
- OWASP guidelines compliance

**Dependency Security:**
- Minimal external dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Trusted sources only (Font Awesome from official CDN)

### Layer 3: Deployment Security

**GitHub Pages Security:**
- HTTPS enforcement (automatic)
- Custom domain with SSL/TLS
- Security headers implementation
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- No server-side vulnerabilities (static site)

**Asset Security:**
- All assets served from same origin
- Optimized images with no metadata
- SVG files sanitized
- No executable content in assets

### Layer 4: Data Protection

**Information Security:**
- No sensitive data storage in repository
- Figma tokens and API keys in .gitignore
- Contact form data handled securely
- No cookies or local storage of sensitive information

**Privacy Protection:**
- Minimal data collection
- Clear privacy practices
- Secure contact form handling
- No tracking without consent

## Backup Strategy

### Multi-Tier Backup System

**Tier 1: Git Repository Backup**
- Automated daily backups to local storage
- Full git history preservation
- Branch and tag backup
- Remote repository mirroring

**Tier 2: File System Backup**
- Complete project files archive
- Asset backup with integrity verification
- Documentation backup
- Configuration files backup

**Tier 3: Content Backup**
- Structured content extraction
- Asset organization backup
- Documentation versioning
- Visual references preservation

### Backup Locations

**Primary Backup:**
- Local backup directory: `~/Backups/Pikzilla-Racing/`
- Automated retention policy (10 most recent backups)
- Integrity verification for all backups

**Secondary Backup (Recommended):**
- Cloud storage backup (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- External drive backup for critical data
- Network-attached storage (NAS) backup

**Offsite Backup:**
- GitHub repository serves as offsite backup
- Additional remote git repositories (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Cloud-based backup services

### Backup Schedule

**Daily Backups:**
- Automated git repository backup
- Project files snapshot
- Content structure backup

**Weekly Backups:**
- Full system backup verification
- Backup integrity testing
- Documentation updates

**Monthly Backups:**
- Complete backup system review
- Backup restoration testing
- Security audit of backup procedures

## Backup Procedures

### Automated Backup Script

The project includes `backup-script.sh` which provides:

**Features:**
- Git repository bare clone backup
- Complete project files archive (tar.gz)
- Structured content backup
- Backup manifest generation
- Integrity verification
- Automatic cleanup of old backups

**Usage:**
```bash
# Make script executable (one time)
chmod +x backup-script.sh

# Run backup
./backup-script.sh
```

**Backup Contents:**
- `{backup_name}_git_repo.git` - Full git repository
- `{backup_name}_files.tar.gz` - Complete project archive
- `{backup_name}_content/` - Structured content backup
- `{backup_name}_manifest.txt` - Backup details and verification

### Manual Backup Procedures

**Emergency Backup:**
1. Create immediate git backup: `git clone --bare . backup.git`
2. Archive project files: `tar -czf emergency_backup.tar.gz .`
3. Copy to secure location
4. Verify backup integrity

**Pre-Deployment Backup:**
1. Run automated backup script
2. Verify all changes are committed
3. Create deployment tag
4. Document deployment state

### Backup Verification

**Automated Verification:**
- File existence checks
- Archive integrity verification
- Git repository validation
- Size and timestamp verification

**Manual Verification (Monthly):**
- Restore test from random backup
- Verify all files are accessible
- Test git repository functionality
- Validate asset integrity

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Accidental File Deletion**
1. Check git history for file recovery
2. Restore from most recent backup
3. Verify file integrity
4. Test functionality

**Scenario 2: Repository Corruption**
1. Clone from GitHub remote repository
2. Restore from local git backup
3. Verify commit history
4. Rebuild working directory

**Scenario 3: Complete System Loss**
1. Set up new development environment
2. Clone from GitHub repository
3. Restore assets from backup
4. Verify deployment functionality

**Scenario 4: GitHub Account Compromise**
1. Secure GitHub account
2. Restore from local git backup
3. Create new repository if needed
4. Update deployment settings

### Recovery Procedures

**Step 1: Assessment**
- Identify scope of data loss
- Determine recovery requirements
- Select appropriate backup source
- Estimate recovery time

**Step 2: Recovery**
- Restore from most recent valid backup
- Verify data integrity
- Test functionality
- Document recovery process

**Step 3: Validation**
- Compare restored data with expected state
- Test all website functionality
- Verify deployment works correctly
- Update documentation

**Step 4: Prevention**
- Analyze cause of data loss
- Implement additional safeguards
- Update backup procedures
- Train team on prevention

## Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

**Repository Monitoring:**
- GitHub security alerts
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Commit history monitoring

**Website Monitoring:**
- Uptime monitoring
