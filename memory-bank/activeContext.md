# Pikzilla Racing Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus of the Pikzilla Racing website project is the implementation of all six main pages based on the visual references provided. We have successfully created the following pages:

1. **Home Page**: Landing page with hero section, welcome area, and news cards
2. **Team Page**: Team member profiles, organization structure, and gallery
3. **Cars Page**: Vehicle showcase with specifications and details
4. **Racing Page**: Upcoming and past racing events
5. **Blog Page**: News articles and stories from the racing world
6. **Contact Page**: Contact form and information

Each page has been implemented with responsive design principles, following the design system established in the CSS variables and maintaining consistency across the site.

## Recent Changes

### Page Implementation
- Created component structure for all six main pages
- Implemented page-specific CSS for styling
- Added responsive design for all screen sizes
- Integrated assets from the Graphic Design Assets folder

### Asset Management
- Copied assets from the source directory to the public/assets directory
- Organized assets by type (Icons, Images, Logo, Vectors)
- Implemented proper asset loading in components

### Styling System
- Utilized CSS variables for consistent theming
- Created component-specific CSS files
- Implemented responsive breakpoints
- Added animations and transitions for interactive elements

## Active Decisions

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Using a dark theme with orange accents to convey speed and excitement
- **Typography**: Using a modern, clean font hierarchy for readability
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing system based on a 4px grid
- **Component Patterns**: Reusable card designs, buttons, and section layouts

### Technical Approach
- **CSS Strategy**: Using component-specific CSS files instead of CSS-in-JS for better separation of concerns
- **Asset Loading**: Loading assets from the public directory for better caching and optimization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for larger screens
- **Component Structure**: Hierarchical component structure with clear separation of concerns

### Content Strategy
- **Image Selection**: Using high-quality images that showcase racing vehicles and team members
- **Copy Tone**: Professional yet exciting language that conveys the thrill of racing
- **Call-to-Action Placement**: Strategic placement of CTAs to encourage user engagement
- **Information Hierarchy**: Clear hierarchy of information to guide users through the content
