- Assets are properly loaded and displayed
- Navigation between pages works correctly
- Styling is consistent across the site
- The website matches the visual references provided

### Known Issues
- Development environment issues with Vite
- Some asset path management challenges
- Need for additional interactive elements
- Form submission not yet implemented
- Some responsive design edge cases to address

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to resolve the development environment issues and enhance the interactivity of the website. This includes:

1. Fixing the Vite development server
2. Adding animations and transitions
3. Implementing form validation and submission
4. Optimizing performance and loading times
5. Improving accessibility features
